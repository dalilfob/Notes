CS 256 Notes @ 11/30/2012
-------------------------

Figure * fs = new Circle(5);

  fs->getArea(); 
  (*fs).getArea();

  CAN NOT use . operator on pointer itself, not a member, have to dereference. 

  Virtual function, declare 'virtual' in base class, requires derived classes
  to implement said function. 

  Pure Virtual Functions:
  ----------------------

  Similar to abstract/interfaces in Java

  virtual int fn() = 0; // pure virtual function 
  virtual double getArea() = 0; 

  Abstract class: Can not instantiate an object of that class

  Pure virtual function: all derived classes must implement this function,
    also can not instantiate an object of this. 



  Function Templates:
    
  template <class T>
  void swap(T& var1, T& var2) {
          T temp;
          temp = var1;
          var1 = var2;
          var2 = temp;
  }

EXAM FRIDAY DEC 7, 11:30pm - 1:30pm

Office hours:
  Monday Dec 3, 8:30am - 9:15am
  Wednesday Dec 5, 9am-10am

  Matrials turn in deadlin:
    Friday Dec. 7, before 11:30am

    Function Template, Class Template...


 Final Exam:

  Basics, Flow of Control, Functions

  Function Parameters passing and Overloading, call by reference

  Arrays
  
  Structs and Classes
  Constructors and other tools

  Call by array is different from others

  Operators overloading:
    - cin, cout, +/-/*/ everything

  Pointers

  Recursive 

  Exception Handling (?) maybe

  Inhertiance

  Polymorphism and Virtual Functions

  Templates: class & functions


  3. Definition questions, code fragment, 2 big coding problems
