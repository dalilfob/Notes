### FINAL
- Can put ALU OPS on the Green Sheet
- Calculator
- WEDNESDAY 9:10 AM is FINAL

- No performance from chapter 1
    - Performance from cycles will be asked

- Forwarding, Pipelining, Branches (taken no taken)
- Cache
- Temporal vs Spatial
- Cache Performance 
- Use Miss Penalty / Hit Rate
- Calculate Cache Size
- Calculate Effective CPI
- Storage, RAID, disk, flash, nand, nor, material, (non)volatile
- IO: 
    - DMA
    - Polling
    - Interrupt
    - Which is better for which situation

- Floating Point Representation
- Multiplication
    - Functional units (input/output)
    - Sign
    - Etc 
    - Check overflow

- Floating Point addition hardware block diagram
- Floating Point Subtraction (?)
    - Negation gate(?)

- 0.0 will not be in the final (the special case)
    - if (fp1 || fp2) == 0 ? the one that's not zero : normal addition

- BNE, JAL, ADDI, full understand these
- Be able to introduce new instructions (any kind)
    - New Controls, New ALU Op, new mux, etc

- Questions based on figure 4.17
    - Be able to add to data path
