### Homework 4 Review
- For ``ori`` you could add a multiplexer somewhere, no clue what's going on again...
- Or modify ALUop and say 11 is ``ori`` 
- Could manipulate function code (add a multiplexer and have a static one) 


- For BNE you could add the mux with the not/inverter 

- For BNE you could also add a not from the ALU ``zero`` output to an AND gate, and perform bitwise AND with a new control called ``bne`` and have that go to another mux 

### Project 2
- There will be more than 4 cycles even if it's not in the description
- ALOop is 3 bits (?)
- Write a page (double spaced)
