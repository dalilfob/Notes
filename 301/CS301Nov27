CS 301 Notes @ 11/27/2012

FINAL ON THURSDAY:

  - First section, taylor's theorem, error

  - Root finding definitely 2+ questions
    Bisection, Secant, Newtons, False Position (NO MODIFIED)

  - Interpolation:
      -Direct
      -Divided
      -Lagrange 
      - NEWTONS form
    -Probably no derivations

  - Integration:
      -Upper / Lower
      -Trapezoidal
      -Simpsons 1/3 

      and composite for both

      -ROBERGS , basic idea of robergs and composite trapezoidal
      put it into trapezoid rule (2^n) 

       R(n,0) <-- have to memorize this

   - DEFINITELY linear interpolation:
     -Cramers
     -Gauss Naieve
     -Pivoting
