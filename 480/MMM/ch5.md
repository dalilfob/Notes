## Chapter 5 The Second System Effect

### Interactive Discipline for the Architect

- Work against a budget
- Estimations
- Revise estimating technique upward, design downward per iteration

- Early continuous communication = good cost readings 

- Design estimate too high: cut design, or challenge estimate via cheaper implementations

    - builder has inventing and creative responsiblity for implementation; therefore suggestions not dictations

    - suggest implementation, prepare for alternative

    - quietly, privatel (discrete)

    - forego credit/merit


### Self-Discipline

- Architects first work is apt to be spare and clean

- Tendency to over design 2nd system
    - IBM 709 to 7090
    - Stretch Computer

- Tendency to refine techniques whose very existence has been made obsolete by changes in basic system assumptions

- Linkage editor: load separately compiled programs and resolve cross-references
    - static overlay 
    - TESTRAN debugging facility
        - batch debugging
        - becomming obsolete


- How to avoid 2nd systems effect
    - Be conscious of peculiar hazards of the system

    - Exert extra self-discipline and avoid functional ornamentation

    - Avoid extrapolation of functions that are obviated by changes in assumptions

- Assign each function a value, capability x worth at most m bytes and n microsections

- Project manger should insist on a senior architect with at least 2 systems under belt
