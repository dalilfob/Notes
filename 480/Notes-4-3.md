# Notes CS 480 Software Engineering
## 4/3/2013

## Software Engineering
- Software Engineering: creating cost-effective solutions to practical problems by applying scientific knowledge to building things in the service of mankin

- Comp. Sci vs Software Engineering
	- Theoretical vs Practical

- Software Engineering vs Other Engineering Fields
	- Intangible
	- Dependency on others
	- FLexibility
	- No manufacturing cost
	- Doesn't Rust

- Engineering Mentality 

- Not purely about management 
- Not about current tools
    - JUnit
    - HG
    - Eclipse
    - ANT/Maven


> You will learn the above, but via google and as a byproduct of this course

## What we'll see in Software Engineering
- Tradeoffs
    - Scenario: developer, testsers, etc
        - Would you use Unit Testing (?)
    - Given some assumptions, make some logical arguments
    - Linked Lists vs Arrays
        - Depends on access vs dynamic/static size constraints
- Risk 
    - Likelihood of a bad thing vs consequence of a bad thing

- Economics
    - Manpower
    
- Change
    - Software that doesn't change it useless
    - Software development is a battle against entropy and you are going to lose, so judge your development by how slowly is degrades

- Reflection

## Team Dynamics
- Forming
    - Friendly: Low conflict / Low work
- Storming
    - High Conflict / Low Work
- Norming
    - Medium Conflict / Medium Work 
- Performing
   - Medium Conflict / High Work 

## Communication
- ``O(n^2)``
