### What is an algorithm
**Algorithm**: A simple, unambiguous, mechanical procedure to carry out some task

Why algorithm instead of program?
1. Writing an algorithm is simple (we don't need to worry about the detailed implementation, or the language syntax)
2. An algorithm is eaiser to read than a program written in, for instance, C 

### How to represent an algorithm?
- Give a description in english
- Pseudo code
- Graphical (flow chart)
