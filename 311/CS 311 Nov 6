Right Linear Grammar:
	RLG is a CFG 

RLG:
	A -> xB
	or
	A -> x

We will show RLG is identical
to a REGULAR LANGUAGE  (anything recognized by 
regex or FSA)

By virtue of this, we can show
that a regular language is a subset
of Context Free Grammar, and therefore
CFG is more powerful than Regular Languages


Theorem: The class of regular languages is identical to the class of right linear languages.
	
	- $\forall$ fsa M , $\exists$ a RLG G such that L(M) = L(G)
		- Regular language (FSA/REGEX) , RLG (CFG that is right linear)
		
		E.G. (see notes for diagram)
