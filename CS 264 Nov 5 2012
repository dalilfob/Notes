CS 264 Notes @ 11/5/2012

Lab 3 Explaination:
	
	- load each integer separately, via l1, t1,t2,t3...etc

    - All represented by 2s complement, therefore when printing
    will print as 2s complement and if there are differences give
    an explaination 

    - for each integer shift right logical 1 bit
    	- store in another register and print them

    etc for the rest

    keep spaces so you can comment

    print the program & the output
    
    give an explaination (perhaps in the program code) of
    each operation and how it was done and why that was the output

    (can do either in program or printout, as long as it makes sense which operation
    is being performed)

    
Two's Example:
    100000 (32 negative though)
    011111
         1
    ------
    100000
    convert to dec: 32, it's negative, so -32
