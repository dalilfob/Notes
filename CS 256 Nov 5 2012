CS 256 Notes @ 11/5/2012

Note:
	When doing 
	Complex(double real = 0, double image = 0);

	can only use this in prototype

	actual function definition

	will NOT allow defaulting values

	so header: give default in the stub
	   source: do not do that stuffs...

------------------------------------------------

Class Type Member Variables:
	- Class member variables can be any type
	- Including objects of other classes
	- Type of class relationship
		- Powerful OOP principle

	-Need special notation for constructors
		- So they can call "back" to member object's constructor

Only Static member function can access static data members 
Static data members must be initialized
