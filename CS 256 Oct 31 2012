CS 256 Notes @ 10/31/2012

// DEFAULT PARAMETER CONSTRUCTOR
Rational::Rational(int num = 0, int den = 1) {
	numerator = num;
	denominator = den;
}

this allows for
	Rational()
	Rational(5);
	Rational(1,2);

to declare a member function (has to be part of class) constant:

int getNumerator() const;

and 

int Rational::getNumerator () const {
	return numerator; 
}

this only works for READ only members,
but mutators can NOT bet const, because
they have write access to members
